Our next wonderful sponsor is [TechSmith](http://techsmith.com/).

TechSmith is the name behind [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/) and [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp), two of the most popular screencasting/capture applications for Windows and Mac.

People everywhere use their products to grab images and record content straight off their computer screens to create dynamic presentations and screencasts. With their products, people communicate more effectively and create interest with engaging visuals and sharp videos that grab attention and keep it. TechSmith develops and updates their innovative software every day and plans to continue expanding their existing products to support the Mac platform.

Weâ€™d like to thank TechSmith for their continuing support of BarCamps around the world.
