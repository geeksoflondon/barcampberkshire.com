We hope you all enjoyed BarCamp Berkshire #1. We had a great time and judging from the survey we sent out and all the great comments we assume you did too. We had more than 150 people over for the weekend, lots and lots of sessions ([see Lanyrd for details](http://lanyrd.com/2012/a-barcamp-near-london/)).

It's all over now, but luckily we still have the photos!

Thanks to the awesome [Martin Cunningham](http://www.flickr.com/photos/martin_88/sets/72157630500417932/) for taking some very nice photos of it all as usual.

We would also like to thank our awesome sponsors for making this possible: [The Lab](/blog/2012/05/21/thelab/), [TechSmith](/blog/2012/06/24/sponsor-techsmith/), [Bytemark](/blog/2012/06/27/sponsor-bytemark/) and [PayPal](/blog/2012/06/27/sponsor-bytemark/).

And finally we'd like to thank our volunteers and you, the attendees. Do you think we should do this again? Was the venue awesome enough for us to return for BarCamp Berkshire #2? Let us know in the comments.
