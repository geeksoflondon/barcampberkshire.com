We are pleased to announce our final sponsor: [PayPal](http://www.paypal.co.uk/).

PayPal is the worldâ€™s leading online payments provider. They work closely with startup businesses in more than 190 countries to enable payments and generate revenue on their web sites.

They were the first global payments solution provider to open their API, allowing developers the opportunity to monetise their applications across social media, web and mobile platforms.

PayPal has been a long time sponsor of BarCamp London and other Geeks of London events and we thank them for their continued support.
